1) check if anaconda is installed locally
conda --version
https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest/

miniconda will be enough for creating venv and dependencies

During the installation, you might be prompted to add Anaconda to the system PATH. If not, and if you encounter issues, you can add it manually:

On Windows, you can check "Add Anaconda to my PATH environment variable" during installation.
On Linux/Mac, you may need to add the following line to your shell profile file (e.g., .bashrc or .zshrc):

2) conda create --name gxe python=3.9

3) conda activate gxe

4) conda install --file requirements.txt -c conda-forge  (takes some time so wait for it)
